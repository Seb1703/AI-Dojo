# Golden Gate Estate - Data Science Project

Welcome to the Golden Gate Estate Data Science project repository! In this repository, you will find a comprehensive guide to our data analysis and modeling process, following the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology.

## Project Overview
We have created a Jupyter Notebook, named `Ai_Workshop2.ipynb`, that takes you through our journey of understanding, analyzing, and modeling data for a fictional company, Golden Gate Estate. The primary objective of this project is to predict house prices within the estate.

## Opening the Jupyter Notebook

To open and work with the Jupyter Notebook, follow these steps:

**Step 1:** Make sure Visual Studio Code (VSC) is installed on your system.

**Step 2:** Open VSC.

**Step 3:** If you don't already have Jupyter Notebook installed, you can install it using pip by running this command in VSC's integrated terminal:

```
pip install notebook
```

**Step 4:** After installing Jupyter Notebook, you can start it by running the following command in VSC's integrated terminal:

```
jupyter notebook
```

**Step 5:** Your web browser will open, and you will see an overview of the files in the project directory. Click on `Ai_Workshop2.ipynb` to open and edit the Jupyter Notebook.

## Models Built
Our analysis and modeling process involved the development of both a classifier and a regression model. These models were constructed using state-of-the-art data science techniques to ensure accurate predictions and insights.

## Streamlit App Deployment
To make our models accessible, you need to run the file "models.py" and afterwards the file "streamlit_app.py".

This repository is designed to provide a transparent and replicable view of our data science project for the Golden Gate Estate. We hope it serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in data analysis, modeling, or the CRISP-DM process.

Happy exploring!
